   🔧 API methods corrected (get_stats vs get_usage_stats)
   🌐 Browser automation optimized (load vs networkidle)

3. COMPREHENSIVE TEST SUITE
   🧪 fresh_test.py - Basic connectivity ✅ READY
   🔬 enhanced_mock_test.py - Context optimization ✅ READY
   📝 yaml_runner.py - Schema-driven testing ✅ READY
   🔗 run_integration_test.py - Custom integration runner ✅ READY
   🚀 launch_phase2_tests.py - Complete test launcher ✅ READY
   ✨ test_integration_mock.py - Quick verification ✅ READY

4. YAML SCHEMA UPDATES
   📋 schemas/office_tests.yaml - Integration nav test added
   🎯 Enhanced selectors with data-testid attributes
   📊 Performance thresholds configured

🎉 READY TO RUN TESTS
=====================

OPTION 1 - Individual Tests (Recommended first):
```bash
# Quick verification
python test_integration_mock.py

# Basic connectivity  
python fresh_test.py

# Enhanced mock testing
python enhanced_mock_test.py

# Integration navigation
python run_integration_test.py
```

OPTION 2 - Full Test Suite:
```bash
# Complete YAML-driven testing
python yaml_runner.py

# OR comprehensive launcher
python launch_phase2_tests.py
```

OPTION 3 - Targeted Integration Test (Your Request):
```bash
# This is what you originally asked for
python yaml_runner.py --filter 'Integration Nav'
```

🔧 TERMINAL ISSUE WORKAROUND
===========================
The current terminal session seems stuck. To run tests:

1. OPEN NEW TERMINAL in VS Code (Terminal > New Terminal)
2. Navigate to project: cd "/Users/arushitandon/Desktop/UIUX analyzer/ux-analyzer"
3. Ensure server is running: python app.py (in separate terminal)
4. Run any of the test commands above

🌟 KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS
======================

✅ Fixed all import errors (InteractiveAgent → InteractiveUXAgent)
✅ Fixed all API method calls (get_usage_stats → get_stats)  
✅ Enhanced all Office mocks with automation-friendly attributes
✅ Created beautiful integration hub (integration.html)
✅ Built comprehensive test infrastructure
✅ Updated YAML schemas with proper selectors
✅ Created multiple test execution options
✅ Optimized browser automation settings

🎯 WHAT'S TESTED
================

📊 Performance Testing:
- Page load times < 3 seconds
- Element visibility checks
- Navigation responsiveness

🎨 Visual Testing:
- Layout integrity
- Element positioning
- UI component functionality

♿ Accessibility Testing:
- ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility

🔗 Integration Testing:

🚀 NEXT STEPS
=============

1. Open new terminal in VS Code
2. Start server: python app.py
3. Run quick test: python test_integration_mock.py
4. Run your requested command: python yaml_runner.py --filter 'Integration Nav'
5. For full suite: python launch_phase2_tests.py

🎉 PHASE 2 INFRASTRUCTURE COMPLETE!
