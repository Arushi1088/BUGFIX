- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing
- **Status Checks**: System health monitoring

## 🚀 Currently Active

### Server Status
```
🌐 Flask Server: http://localhost:8000
📄 Word Mock: http://localhost:8000/mocks/word.html
📊 Excel Mock: http://localhost:8000/mocks/excel.html  
📑 PowerPoint Mock: http://localhost:8000/mocks/powerpoint.html
```

### Browser Access
All three Office mocks are now open in VS Code's Simple Browser and fully interactive!

## 🎯 Phase 2 Capabilities

### 1. **YAML-Driven Testing**
```yaml
tests:
  - name: "Word Document Creation"
    target: "word.html"
    steps:
      - action: "click"
        selector: "#new-doc"
      - action: "type"
        selector: "#editor"
        text: "Hello World"
    expectations:
      - type: "dom"
        selector: "#editor"
        contains: "Hello World"
```

### 2. **Interactive Mock Testing**
- Real-time interaction with Office applications
- Visual feedback and user experience testing
- Cross-application workflow testing

### 3. **Advanced Reporting**
- Performance metrics (load time, responsiveness)
- Visual regression detection
- Accessibility compliance checking
- Detailed execution logs

### 4. **Integration Ready**
- Compatible with existing InteractiveUXAgent
- Extensible for live Office integration
- Scalable test scenario management

## 🔄 Next Steps Available

### Immediate Testing
1. **Manual Testing**: All mocks open in browser - test interactivity
2. **YAML Execution**: Run `python yaml_runner.py` for automated tests
3. **Report Generation**: Execute advanced reporting capabilities

### Advanced Features  
1. **Live Office Integration**: Connect to real Office applications
2. **Enhanced Visual Testing**: Screenshot comparison and analysis
3. **Performance Benchmarking**: Detailed timing and efficiency metrics
4. **Multi-User Scenarios**: Collaborative testing workflows

## 🏆 Achievement Summary

✅ **Phase 1**: Core UX analysis engine with rate limiting, batching, disambiguation  
✅ **Phase 2**: Office application integration with YAML-driven testing system  
🚀 **Ready**: For advanced features and live Office integration!
